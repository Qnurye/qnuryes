> Linking to other sites isn't something to be scared of; in fact, using external links can help establish trustworthiness (for example, citing your sources). Link out to external sites when it makes sense, and provide context to your readers about what they can expect.

Friend links are an ancient ritual of the internet community. According to Google's famous PageRank algorithm, the importance of a webpage is not only determined by its own content but also by the quality and quantity of other webpages linking to it. Early internet natives linked to each other, creating another layer of network in terms of behavior. This tradition has continued. In my opinion, its modern significance has evolved into a piece of memory film from the non-recommendation algorithm mainstream era.
