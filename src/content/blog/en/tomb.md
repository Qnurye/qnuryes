description: "**In youth,** everything seems so close—that is the future. In old age, everything seems so distant—that is the past."

Growth and aging are two inevitable things that are causally related. Beyond the many nights of insomnia due to embarrassing past events, I also occasionally marvel at how great my past self was. Whether good or bad, events either feel like they happened just yesterday or as if they belonged to a different century. When I flip through an old notebook from middle school, the author feels like another buried version of myself. I am proud of who I am today and comforted by who I used to be. The evidence left behind in organic matter and hard drives has contributed to my being. I treat this place as my tombstone, writing eulogies for the past that has been buried. You, as a visitor, may silently mourn for a part of me that has died, and then celebrate with me the rebirth of another part.

Thinking and output happen simultaneously. Perhaps our brains also function as Next Token Prediction, which might explain the concept of output-driven learning. However, the decline of imagination and the loss of expressive desire are occurring at an age that doesn’t seem quite right for me. I will share some of my interesting thoughts here to motivate myself to keep thinking and progressing. You can subscribe to my death knell via RSS or a monthly newsletter to stay updated on my latest activities. Meanwhile, please carefully read the funeral rites below.
