Growth and aging are two inevitable things that are causally related. Beyond the many nights of insomnia due to embarrassing past events, I also occasionally marvel at how great my past self was. Whether good or bad, events either feel like they happened just yesterday or as if they belonged to a different century. When I flip through an old notebook from middle school, the author feels like another buried version of myself. I am proud of who I am today and comforted by who I used to be. The evidence left behind in organic matter and hard drives has contributed to my being. I treat this place as my tombstone, writing eulogies for the past that has been buried. You, as a visitor, may silently mourn for a part of me that has died, and then celebrate with me the rebirth of another part.

I will share some of my interesting thoughts here to motivate myself to keep thinking and progressing.
